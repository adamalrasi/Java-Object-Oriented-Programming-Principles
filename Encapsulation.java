/*
Objectives:
- Explain the OOP principle of encapsulation
- Be able to give an example of encapsulation in the real world
- Understand how encapsulation applies to programming

Encapsulation is the mechanism of hiding of data implementation by restricting access to public methods. Instance variables are kept private and accessor methods are made public to achieve this.

- Provide a simple consistent interface to use the object
- Hide data and implementation details inside
- Each class has a well-defined responsibility
